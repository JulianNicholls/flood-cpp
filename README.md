# Flood Puzzle

[Simon Tatham's flood puzzle in C++ with Raylib](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/flood.html)

I wrote this in [Ruby with Gosu](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Gosu-FloodPuzzle) 
a few years ago, actually a lot more years ago than I remembered :). 

## Build

It is built using cmake

Clone the repository

`cd` into the cloned directory and make a `build` directory.

`cd` into the `build` directory, and run

```
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

then you can run `flood`

et voila.

## Caveat

Although I've only built and run this on my Mac, it should build and run on Windows and Linux, I think.
